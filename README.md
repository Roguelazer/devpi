/dev/pi
=======

Have you ever been sitting at your computer, doing something interesting
with Linux, and been wishing that you had more sources of random-looking (but
not actually random) data for your program? /dev/zero is fast, but it's so...
predictable. /dev/urandom has lots of entropy, but meh.

Enter */dev/pi*. It's irrationally better.
